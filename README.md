# infographic
Due to the recent unfortunate airline crashes and the news and media bombarding the public with reports and figures about airline safety trends to prove air is no longer a safe way to travel. As a data science student, I have visualized the data using six different matrices using tableau software to find airline safety insights.
In addition, I have created infographics to summarize the insights that i have extracted using many visual methods. 
# Methodology:
